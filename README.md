# Utilities
* `frmtrnm`\
  `frmtrnm` automates the formatting and renaming of files (especially for a
  large number of them requiring repetitive renaming).  This can be
  configured to replace any characters and patterns, but was made to avoid
  specifically backslashes and quotations when typing filenames in shells.
* `bkmk`\
  `bkmk` is a python program to add, update, remove, and view bookmarks.
  Although this can be done with in a simple text file, it is apparently
  cumbersome when you are too quick.
