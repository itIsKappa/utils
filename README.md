# Utilities

* `frmtrnm`\
  `frmtrnm` automates the formatting and renaming of files (especially for a
  large number of them requiring repetitive renaming).  It can be configured
  to replace any characters and patterns, but was made specifically to avoid
  backslashes and quotations when typing filenames in shells.

* `bkmk`\
  `bkmk` is a very simple generalized system-wide bookmark manager.  It
  currently provides essential features — add; update; remove — and a tabular
  display of entered bookmarks.

* `fltree`\
  `fltree` is a command-line utility of convenience for an instant pretty
  visualization of any arbitrary tree data (rooted tree).  It can either read
  from standard input or from a specified file.

The manual for each above can be found in `README.md` of their respective
directories.
