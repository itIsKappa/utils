# Utilities

* `frmtrnm`\
  `frmtrnm` automates the formatting and renaming of files (especially for a
  large number of them requiring repetitive renaming).  It can be configured
  to replace any characters and patterns, but was made specifically to avoid
  backslashes and quotations when typing filenames in shells.
* `bkmk`\
  `bkmk` is a very simple system-wide bookmark manager.  It currently
  provides essential features — add; update; remove — and a tabular display
  of entered bookmarks.

The manual for each above can be found in `HELP.md`.
